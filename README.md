QA Engineer Test
This framework is about Backend Automation Testing
I started my work by analyzing API document
Then I created my scenarios, and I executed them manually on Postman
After this I wrote my test scripts by using RestAssured-Java.
Framework supports parallel execution and data-driven testing
Tools : Postman, Maven, Java, RestAssured, TestNG, Apache POI
